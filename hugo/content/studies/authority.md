## Lesson

### The Authority Of Jesus Christ

* **Declared By The Father** Matt 17:1-5 cf 2 Pet 1:16-18
  * Note: The Christian does not live under the old (Mosaic) covenant, but he lives by the new covenant. Principles from the old covenant are still binding (e.g. faith Gen 15:6; Hab 2:4; Rm 1:17) but the laws relating only to the Jews are not cf Jer 31:31-34 (Heb 8:6-13; 9:15-17); Gal 3:23-26; 4:21-5:1; et al.
* **Declared By The Son** Matt 28:18; Jn 5:19-29; 12:44-50; 14:6; 17: 1-2; Lk 6:46
* **Declared By The Holy Spirit**
  * In The Old Testament Dt 18:15, cf Acts 3:17-26
  * In The New Testament Eph 1:22; Heb 1:1-2; 2:1-4; 5: 9

* **Guided By The Holy Spirit**
  * The promise Jn 14:25-26; 15:26-27; 16:12-16 (cf 17:6-21; Mk 13:9-11)
  * The practice 1 Cor 2:1-13; Gal. 1:11-12; Eph 2:20; 3:3-5; .1 Thess 2: 1-3; 2 Pet 1:3-4, 19-21; Rev 1:1-2

### The Authority Of The Bible

* **It Is All Sufficient** Jn 8:31; 12:44-50; 17:17; 20:30-31; Rm 16:25-26; 2 Cor 1:13; Eph 3:3-4; 2 Tim 2:15; 3:15-17; 1 Jn 5:13; Ps 19: 7-11; 119:97-104, 130
* **It Alone Is To Be Followed** Acts 17:11; 1 Cor 4:6; 14:37; Gal 1:6-9; 1 Jn 4:1-6; 2 Jn 9-11; Rev 22:18-19; Prov 30:5-6; Dt 4:2; 12:32; Ps 119:104; 128; Rm 16:17

  * The words of Jesus, his apostles and prophets alone Eph 2:17-20
  * The words found only in God's word 2 Tim 3:15-17; 2 Jn 9-11

  * **My heart** Jer 13:10; 17:9; Acts 10:1-2, 22 cf 11:14; 17:22-23; Rm 10:2; 1 Cor 12:2 (feelings, sincerity, etc.)
  * **Whatever seems right** Dt 12:8; Jud 17:6; Prov 16:25
  * **Man’s doctrines** Jer 10:2-3; Mk 7:6-9; Acts 5:29; Rm 16:17; Col 2:8, 22; 2 Tim 4:3-4
  * **The majority** Matt 7:13-14; 22:14
