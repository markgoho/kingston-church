**Because of Covid-19, we have moved all of our gatherings (worship, Bible study) to [WebEx](https://schuylersignor.my.webex.com/meet/babbootoo)**.

We welcome any comments or questions you may have.

You may also email us for a FREE Bible Correspondence Course, with a FREE Bible, if you need one. The course is simple, with straight forward lessons, and Scripturally-based. The course is done through the mail, and there is no obligation. Any information you give us will be kept confidential.

Thanks for visiting our website and we look forward to hearing from you, or maybe even seeing you, soon!
