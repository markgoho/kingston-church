actually that's an appropriate song for the lesson today joy of the Lord is my strength
sometimes I wonder if Christians really believe that
I was looking at an article the other day on how people respond to a crisis or crises or traumas in their life
and
how to deal with a sew on
it occurred to me that sell well
I don't know that Christians are believers will respond differently necessarily to a crisis however they
should in part at least add some things to those responses that the unbeliever or those uninformed wouldn't wouldn't do or wouldn't respond as they wouldn't ad
there are numerous examples in scripture of people facing crisis has the crises
the one that immediately came to my mind was of course David
I want to look at that in 2nd Samuel
how he responded to this crisis in his life
how has relationship with God affected that
and how it should be an example to us
the example of course it's one that's familiar to everyone 2nd Samuel 12
after he had
committed adultery in murdered and so on and so forth Nathan comes to him and tells him what he has done
I will pick it up in verse 9
why have you despise the word of the Lord by doing evil in his sight
you are struck down Uriah the hittite with a sword have taken his wife to be your wife have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon
David are for the sword shall never depart
from your house because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be your wife such as the Lord behold I will raise up evil against you in from your own household
I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion
and he shall live with that your wives and broad daylight
indeed you did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and under the sun
David said to Nathan I have sinned against the Lord
relationship to David the Lord has taken away your sin and you shall not die however because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme
the child also that is born to you shall surely die
so Nathan went to his house
then the Lord struck the child that uriah's Widow for today visited so that he was very sick
David therefore inquired of God for the child and David fast and went and lay all night on the ground
and the Elders of his household Stood Beside him in order to raise him up from the ground but he was unwilling and we're not eat food with them
then it happened on the 7th day that the child died
and the Servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead for they said be home while the child was still alive we spoke to him and he did not listen to our voice how then can we tell him that the child is dead because he might do harm to himself
but when David saw that his servants were Whispering together David perceived that the child is dead
David said you were servants is the child dead and they said he's dead
so David Rose from the ground wash them washed anointed himself changed his clothes and came into the house of the Lord and worship
then he came to his own house and when he requested and when he requested they said food before him and he ate
send a servant said to him what is this thing that you have done while the child was alive you fast in the West End when the child died you were Rose and they food
and he said while the child was still alive I fasted the web for I said who knows the Lord may be gracious to me that the child may live but now he has died why should I say can I bring him back again I'll go to him
but he will not return to me
then David comforted his wife that Sheba
and went into her and lay with her and she gave birth to a son and he named him Solomon
now the lord loves him and sent words for Nathan the prophet and he named him Jedediah for the Lord's sake
how does one without a relationship with God deal with this kind of crisis
any crisis really
particularly like shattering or changing crisis like David is now experiencing
everyone is involved in a crisis at least one but many in their lives
death death of a spouse is a Christ divorce
separation jail term losing a job of a serious physical injury on a positive side marriage is a crisis to get married it's a major radical change in a person's life positive ordinarily
there's many kinds of crises that we encounter not to this magnitude
that David experience here although possibly we think of Jobe in the terrible crisis that he experienced but no degree if we hadn't already we will face a crisis in our lives
how are we going to respond
in this article I was looking at and just driving the way ordinary people respond there a lot of reaction physical tired
changes in sleep patterns by the way we had this for Davis here
appetite changes in eating patterns
physical problems like headaches
mentally there are
changes that take place
trouble thinking clearly
have trouble concentrating
constant repetition of the thoughts of the experience
sometimes you just can't stop thinking about
emotionally there are changes or things that happened to us a person becomes guarded they become distrustful and others often sometimes themselves especially if they're involved
in the crisis like David Muir I mean he at the center of this crisis
they feel a sense of vulnerability being unsafe and more so than ever before they become irritable anxious depressed
depressed in some cases to the point of not functioning in their ordinary daily responsibilities
they start to lose a sense of their own human value
Costco
and even on a greater scale there's a change in life goals sometimes or or once orientation to life
therefore in a spiritual sense sometimes in a good way unbelievers will become Believers but sadly believers
start to doubt their faith
they start to doubt the love that God has for it
they start to doubt God's fairness
especially if
you've contributed to the crisis in a big way like David they would surely start to question their faith or
you know what might be the outcome of their relationship with God
as a result
they if they contribute to the crisis their Agony then might turn into self-destruction
end up killing themselves
although it's insensitive this is this my son that's the ultimate expression of
selfishness I can't take this anymore my pain is too great
awesome people in that position aren't thinking of anybody but themselves their families for example their children may be a mother who kills herself because she can't take the pain of lights and if she's got children that need her song
it's somewhat disingenuous of us however
involved in any crisis to extricate ourselves from any responsibility in other words is there really an innocent party in a divorce
when your child has later in life and violence and crime or drugs or promiscuity or whatever it is have we really done everything we could have
have we really
then the example that we should have been one of our example really exemplary
Damon's David's involvement in this crisis is so blatant he sets the standard of what shouldn't be
so there's little problem and self-examination there
so we have to ask ourselves when there's a crisis where is my responsibility
and in the process of asking ourselves that
stop looking and focusing on the responsibility of others
what was David's price is here well if you know the story against his household and I mean there is Evil Within his household
the applications drawn to one of the sun one of the son commits adultery with his wives as fun as the one who fulfills his promise from God that his his wives with the exposed publicly it's his own son that does that
one of his other Sons rapes his daughter his sister that is the guy that does the writing his own sister
there's Intrigue and Inn in problems and David's life right up until the day of his death and act
does any Intrigue about who's going to take over the throne starts God's got that all worked out
but nevertheless that's a crisis and and 1% a that's a crisis the kind of ends here in one sense but really it only kind of levels off because it never really stops in David's life
but he loses a child and he loses a child directly because of his own responsibility his own actions
the product of his self urges
and he knows that it magnifies it a hundred times the crisis in this life it it it becomes a symbol in David's lights to his lack of self-control in his lack of concern for anyone else but his own self
his disregard for the lives of other he'll kill the cover up the sin
his greed his excesses is failure to honor the god-given position that he had he's the king of Israel he's not just the guy next door down the street he's the king of Israel he becomes a symbol of everything that Israel is
all because of something he wanted and had no light to have
bus
what were his responses to this Christ
that we should emulate we certainly shouldn't emulate his example in the crisis is too wet down there
the first thing is clear I have sinned against the Lord
we're talking about Believers here we're talking about how will Believers respond in a crisis situation in their life
how do I set as I said before this crisis does not have to be as as as great as this time to sing
it could be something we can't even understand what's going on in our lives that seems to be handicapped or in some way causing us to freeze and we don't know what how about how to act
I have sinned against the Lord he begins with repentance and confession of sin against the Lord that's important pick up on that the best cheapest in yet
did David sin against Matthew but yes he did send against Uriah send against all of Israel but David understood acknowledged his responsibility genuine sorrow for his involvement in this crisis and this is probably the most fundamental response to a crisis we should have my role in this crisis
there are no excuses no rationalization no finger pointing well that woman tempted me
well maybe she did unbeknownst to her she tempted by the way but nevertheless
I am in this mess
I am in this mess because I have been a poor father I have been a poor husband a poor neighbor a poor King most of all a poor child of God
against the Lord that's why I dated
should I send again.
every crisis ultimately release the god
even the death of the innocent as in this case
because even that's the consequence of sin in this world whether directly or otherwise
but every crisis a directly release the god in the wing response how we reflect our faith and our trust in God in a crisis that seems absolutely overwhelming to us
so David then turns immediately to prayer and fasting
verses 16 and 17 look at that again
David there for
here's the crisis
David therefore required of God for the child and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground in the Elders of his house all Stood Beside him and arms are raised him up from the ground but he would but he was unwilling and he would not eat food with them he wouldn't what was this Focus I got to go to God with this thing
he didn't go to some secular counselor we're going to leave God out of the picture altogether and not only that maybe antagonistic to True spiritual healing he goes to God
that's part of our problem we go to the wrong people some place we go to the wrong places sometimes it's as well I know what am I going to do just talk somebody talk to a brother or sister
at least you're getting the perspective there of well what would God want us to do how how would God take care of this problem
God is in control of everything David knows that
maybe got to change that they did you want and what we seeing David also is a heart that is willing to accept whatever God's decision is or whatever turns out to be
because he's in control not me I'm out of control I demonstrated that already got I mean that's why we're here that's why I'm on my face on the ground because I was out of control but you're in control ultimately
the Third
respond so kind of a package that way we can proceed this is just that his recognition and acceptance of the situation and verse 22
it says and he said while the child was still alive I fast in the web for I said who knows the Lord may be gracious to me and the child may live but now he's died why should I fast can I bring them back I'll go to him but he will not return to me
yes this is fake
does that mean he doesn't grieve anymore over the Lost Rhino that's not what it's saying but he is saying here's a reality life goes on it's going to go on I can't change
Scottsdale and control his decision was his decision
he knows he needs to proceed with being who he is
what is called to do
so he's the king
we're just regular ordinary everyday Christians but we have a calling and in and we have an identity in Christ and we should continue in that identity we should continue with that calling and not let the things of this World handicap has in the crises that we encounter keep us from being what we can be
a boy that's pretty cold we don't know what's going on in David's car how he's grieving over that child made my guess is he Grieves over it to the Destin took to his last day
it's not just the loss of a child if you can say such a thing but he's directly responsible
but David is going to accept God he's in the SEC disposition come home we're going to have to accept that if my child doesn't come home Dexter comes a point where I just have to accept that there's nothing I can do about it and I keep trying to do what I can do but I'm not going to let it cost me to freeze in My My by everyday life and in what God has called me to do whatever that is
finally
we can call it restoration and revitalization 420a David said he arose from the ground washed anointed himself change this close and came into the house of the Lord and worship
there is a restoration they're not so much to his God cuz he's been With God all along in this but he goes about the business of what he needs to do he cleans up literally the first thing he does is he goes before the father
but he doesn't stop there
Sonnen vs 2524 David comforted his wife and went in and lay with her and she gave birth to a son and I called him sound so
again life is going on
there's no lights here
Celestine Union that Lost the Child previously there's new life and by the way that's not just any new life this is Solomon this is the one that God anointed king so God can even take that terrible crisis that David created and turn it into something powerful and good
the same relationship that started the whole thing illegitimate relationship that started the whole thing
take the kids are loose upstairs
what I want to point out here about David though is there is no wallowing in self-pity
there's no paralyzing depression
not that he's you know the word depressed of the word down that's I like to use those two words that people get down we all get down you get blue whatever word you want to use you get depressed but there's a difference if you're depressed and in the clinical sense
and all you do is focus on your problem and all you do is worry about it and unfortunately if you go to secular and it's some secular people not at all but something for the people that's why you're going to focus on and you can focus on it for 20 years keep going back and forth
the point here is to get out of that in the function doesn't mean you won't be done but you'll be functioning you'll be doing what you was she doing you're not paralyzed you're not neglecting your responsibilities
you're not altering the course of your life away from God
you may have to alter the course of your life more toward God
David. It's ironic that in David's life not just David but really every faithful person scripture
the worst they get the closer they get to God they see the greater knead the desperation
when I saw out of control God's in control
David demonstrates that
with David there was no crisis of Faith because he had a crisis
what him there was no questioning of God's power you still in control he can change things he may not but I'm willing to accept that
there's no questioning of God's love form no questioning of God's parents
but neither is there a stoic resignation to fate
that's not what he has but he does have a realistic recommitment to Faith
this doesn't mean that David didn't experience the physical mental emotional responses that are typical of people in a crisis to find the prices
I mean some of us sometimes go through a trauma that really has no definition to it we don't understand it it's our life is screwed up for some reason you're saying we can point to
David Spirits a hiss hiss crisis is very clearly defined here
but it doesn't always has this clear we know that
but David's response his spiritual response is what gets and threw it that's what's important not as physical responses mental or emotional response was necessary but the spiritual response to through his prayers restoration his revitalization even though
it came out of the David did go through all those other things for physical mental emotional
he's our exam
we can emulate that he is an example I should say we can emulate that exist what we got to do is put it into practice let's not turning for the world to resolve these let's stop quite frankly they've done studies people that have mental and emotional crises in their lives can if they talk to a friend for 2 years or talk to a therapist for 2 years the recovery rate is the same
sing about the friend is they may not be quote on quote professional but it's the connection the relationship that's important to support we should find that in our brothers and sisters somehow
even though we don't know what to say and we don't have all the technical jargon and we certainly don't have the pills to give out we do have the spiritual support that should be there
