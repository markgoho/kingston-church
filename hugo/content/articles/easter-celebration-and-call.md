Jesus of Nazareth did not just experience a resurrection and a new life; he IS the resurrection and the life! More than that, he said, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me shall live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?" (John 11:25-26) "Do YOU believe this?" Easter not only raises this question in our minds; it calls for a response from our hearts.

Jesus' promise to those who believe begins here and now. "He who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, HAS eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life." More than that, he said, "An hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment" (John 5:24, 28-29).

Easter is a celebration of what is for those who hear the words of Jesus, believe in him, and do his will. For the rest, it is only a call to what might be. Are you celebrating?
