About all those trees on which we hang those pretty decorations, there was another tree—"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree'" (Galatians 3:13).

And all those colored lights outlining our comfortable homes, there was another light—"I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12).

And all those lovely gifts we so enjoy giving and receiving, there was another gift—"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life" (John 3:16).

While he has our attention, what do we see and what does he really mean to us?
