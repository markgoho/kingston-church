After Saul heard the word of Jesus Christ, he was asked by the disciple Ananias, "And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name" (Acts 22:16). Saul did not delay; he was baptized into Christ immediately, and began to walk the new life as Paul the apostle.

Why do some people delay? Perhaps they just do not care to make the sacrifices the gospel demands in this life (Matthew 19:16-22). Perhaps they love evil rather than truth (John 3:19-21). Perhaps the truth has been muddled beyond recognition by ecclesiastical traditions, leaving them in a state of confusion or deception (Matthew 15:1-14). Perhaps they are waiting for a more opportune time to make the commitment, but the present time is all they are assured of (2 Corinthians 6:2). Perhaps they are unwilling or afraid to make the break from family, friends, peers, or religions the gospel calls them out of (2 Corinthians 6:14-18).

Only God knows why some people delay. The question is why do you delay?
