December 25th is Jesus' birthday—or so tradition tells us. This is no ordinary birthday. For millions of people it means presents, presents, presents—but not for Jesus! For credit card companies it means charge, charge, charge—in the name of Jesus! For business it means profits, profits, profits—"Praise Jesus!" For most it means debt, debt, debt—"Help me Jesus!"

This is no ordinary birthday. For Matthew it meant the birth of "God with us" to an engaged virgin impregnated by the Holy Spirit, a baby who would save his people from their sins (1:18- 25). For Mark the birth needed no mention. Who knows why? For Luke it meant the birth of "the Son of God" to that same virgin, a baby who would reign as king forever (1.26-38). And if all that is not extraordinary enough, for John it meant the birth of "the Word" who was "in the beginning…with God," and even more, "the Word" who was "God" (1:1, 14)!

This is no ordinary birthday. What does it mean to you—presents, charges, profits, debts? Or does it mean something a little more profound—something spiritual rather than material, soul-saving rather than soul-selling? Does it mean the birth of "God with us" your Savior, "the Son of God" your King, and "the Word" your God?
