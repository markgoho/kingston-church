"I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life" (1John 5:13). There are three basic tenets of the Christian faith alluded to in this verse.

First, "I write these things to you" assumes the individual reader's ability to understand what is written and to benefit directly from it. He need not have some self-appointed authority tell him what it means and how to apply it. Scripture was written to all believers, not just a
select few.

Second, "who believe in the name of the Son of God" by implication necessitates personal faith in the Son, and excludes from the blessings of such faith those who do not believe. It is not just a matter of believing in "something," it is a matter of believing in "the Son."

Third, "so that you may know that you have eternal life" purposes to give the reader assurance that the blessing of eternal life is truly his. His faith need not be troubled by doubt; he can be fully convinced of his relationship with God through reading Scripture.

Do you have this assurance? Do you believe in the Son? Do you read Scripture?
