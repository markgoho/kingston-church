It is hard not to lose sight of what it's all about. Even true believers are blinded by the change in the human spirit at this time of the yearâ€”"Why can't everyday be like Christmas?" Well, everyday is not like Christmas because everyday is unfortunately more in touch with reality. There is a reality behind Christmas, but it has little to do with trees and lights and gifts and "joy to the world."

- It's all about one tree upon which a curse was hung for those who believe (Galatians 3:13-14).
- It's all about one light that delivers believers from spiritual darkness (John 8:12).
- It's all about one gift that brings eternal life to those who believe (John 3:16).
- It's all about one joy shared only by believers unto salvation (1 Peter 1:8-9).

Christmas is all about one reality that must be believed. It is not all about an image we would like to believe.
