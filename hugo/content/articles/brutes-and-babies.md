The ancient Roman Empire addressed overpopulation with feticide. Regrettably, due to primitive medical procedures, mothers often died during abortions. A frequently chosen option was "exposure"—some barbarically left newborns to die in isolated places.

Thank goodness, for modern medical advances. Now a suction device 25 to 30 times as powerful as a common house vacuum can inhale the fetus from the womb, tearing to shreds only the unborn. An option is a long needle inserted in mom's abdomen injecting a saline solution swallowed by the fetus poisoning him to death while his skin completely burns off. As with other equally "civilized" methods, generally, within a few days, mom can go about her business, say to the junior prom or whatever. Thanks to technological and legal advances, only on occasion are newborns abandoned to die a lonely death.

The modern world addresses inconvenience with feticide, but thank goodness not as crudely as those backward brutes aptly described in Romans 1: "as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, being…unloving, unmerciful." Isn't scientific progress a wonderful thing, enabling us to be so much more humane?
