Who is "The Great Satan" anyway? Is it Iraq, North Korea, the United States? Remember when it was Japan, Germany, Russia? It depends on one's perspective—whose side God is on. Of course, each nation assumes God marches under its flag. What if he favors no nation, but only marvels at the presumption of any nation believing he sanctions biological or chemical weapons, "smart bombs," nuclear warheads, or other such creative fruits of
darkened human minds.

There was a time God took sides, when Israel was protecting a seed line predestined to bring forth one who would end "favored nation" status. Israel—God, that is—ultimately triumphed, the Messiah came and established a spiritual kingdom wherein nations ceased to raise swords against one another and war games ended (Isaiah 2:2-4; Genesis 49:10).

Today, every warring nation serves Satan, attempting to resolve human problems with human resources. God favors no nation, for no nation has been delivered from the power of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Messiah, only believers have (Colossians 1:13). Believers are at war, using divine resources, though "not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12), and God is on their side.
