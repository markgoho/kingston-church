The apostle Paul wrote, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ (i.e., died as Christians) have perished" (1 Corinthians 15:17-18). In short, if Jesus of Nazareth did not actually rise from the dead, the hope of eternal life is gone, not only for unbelievers, but for believers as well. Everyone is, so to speak, here today and gone tomorrowâ€”no heaven, no afterlife, but only a perishing.

The Bible presents the resurrection of Jesus as a historical event that took place in space and time. There are only three possibilities to the truth of this claim: it did not happen, it did happen but there is not enough evidence to establish it beyond reasonable doubt, or it did happen and there is enough evidence to establish it beyond reasonable doubt. Traditionally, Christians have held the third possibility, few holding the second. Yet, today, some "Christians" hold the first, which makes no sense in view of Scripture.

Nevertheless, you decide. Examine the evidence; your future may hang on it.
