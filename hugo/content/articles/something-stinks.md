She is 12 years old and poor. Her schoolteachers and social workers advised her to have an abortion. A local church offered to pay the bills, if she would have the baby. Her parents want to support the child and her baby. Abortion advocates are "furious," ranting "cash for babies is tantamount to bribery, and it stinks to high heaven." Buy here is what really bugs them, it "removes choice," they say. Oh? Actually, it offers an option to their agendaâ€”the systematic brutal destruction of innocent defenseless human lives. Ironically, they call this insanity the "right of choice," but when a choice is offered that exposes their choice for what it really is, they whine, "it stinks." Something stinks all right, but it is not protection of the helpless unborn, whatever the cost.

How does a society get to a point that some people become furious over options that preserve human life? More likely than not, these people are infuriated by genocide, but why not feticide? Human holocaust at any level of existence should be abhorrent to all people. Perhaps such people have been taken "captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ" (Colossians 2:8). The devil works best by covering evil with a deceptive veneer of human wisdom, but the reality continues to stink.
