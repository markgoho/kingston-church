There is an old hymn that asks the question, "Would you be free from the burden of sin?" The hymn also gives the solution, "There is wonder-working pow'r in the precious blood of the Lamb." Hymns have a way of making deep theological truths quite simple.

Jesus said, "this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins" (Matthew 26:28). Somehow, in his death at Calvary, Jesus managed to make forgiveness possible, to free sinners from the burden of sin. Paul later wrote, "Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?" (Romans 6:3) The believer through immersion into Christ is immersed into his death where he poured out his blood. Through baptism the believer contacts the precious blood of the Lamb! That is profound!

But the hymn still asks the simple question, "Would you be free from the burden of sin?" The power to cleanse is still in the blood. The power to choose is still in your heart.
