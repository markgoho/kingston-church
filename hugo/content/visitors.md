description: What visitors should know about the Kingston NY Church of Christ

---
First and foremost, visitors can expect to be greeted with a kind welcome. We strive to make everyone feel like family.

Our worship service begins by lifting our voices up to God in song. We do this to both glorify Him and to encourage one another. All of our singing is done Acappella, like that of the early church.

Between songs, we have times of collective prayer led by one of our members. We also take part in the Lordâ€™s Supper, or Communion, which is a weekly reminder of what Christ did for us on the cross, and the relationship we have with God because of this great sacrifice.

A collection is also taken during our service to help support the work of our congregation in Kingston. We give back a portion of what God has so richly blessed us with. Members are called to give freely and cheerfully, though visitors are under no obligation to give.

After the singing is complete, a sermon is delivered by our preacher. This is the time when we grow in our knowledge of Scripture and are motivated to live lives worthy of Christ. When the sermon is over, we take prayer requests from the congregation and then bring them before God.

There is nothing showy or elaborate about our worship services. We are not a social club or a recreation center. We do not strive to entertain or impress. We simply meet together as we are called to do in order to encourage and love one another.
