### Who We Are

We are a non-denominational body of Christians who believe that Jesus is the Son of God. In all matters of faith and practice, we submit to Scripture alone and not to man-made doctrines, creeds, or traditions. There are thousands of independent churches of Christ throughout the world, each governing its own body, though united in spirit through the work of Christ.

### Our Preacher, Schuyler Signor

Schuyler has been our full-time preacher for the past 18 years. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in New Testament Greek, a Master of Arts degree in the Greek New Testament and a Master of Divinity, from Abilene Christian University.

### What the Bible Says About

**God** He is the Creator of all things ({{< verse verse="Genesis 1" >}}; Hebrews 3:4) and exists as the Father, Son (Jesus Christ) and Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:16-17; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).

**The Bible** The Scriptures are inspired by God and complete. The Bible is the only reliable guide for our lives and is sufficient for all teaching, preaching, and living (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The Scriptures are not open to multiple interpretations and must be approached as the final word on all matters of faith. We approach them by asking what the authorâ€™s intent was for the original readers.

**Jesus Christ** Jesus is the Son of God, who came to earth both fully human and fully God (John 1:1, 14; Hebrews 1:3; Philippians 2:6-8). He lived a sinless life despite being tempted in all things, and offered Himself as a perfect sacrifice on the cross (Hebrews 4:15); he took our place and felt separation from God (Matthew 27:46), so we never have to. He defeated death when he rose from the grave and now sits at the right hand of the Father (Hebrews 2.14-15; Matthew 28; Colossians 3:1).

**Salvation** If one wishes to receive the salvation of God, they must respond appropriately to the Gospel. This includes believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (Matthew 16:15-18; John 5:18; Mark 3:11; 2 Corinthians 1:19) and that he came to earth to die on the cross and shed his blood in order to cleanse us from our sins (John 1:29; 2 Corinthians 5:15). Once this knowledge is established within the believer, they must then submit to God and accept His grace, which is freely given, through baptism (Ephesians 2:8; Titus 3:5). This is a full-body immersion, as in the New Testament. Once one is baptized, they have experienced the new birth (John 3) and have come in contact with the blood of Christ, and are therefore forgiven, sanctified, and redeemed (Romans 6; Acts 2:38).

**The Church** Jesus established the Church as an earthly kingdom of believers, of which he is the head (Colossians 1:18). All who are baptized into Christ have been added to his body, or the Church, or the Kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 12:12-14; Romans 12:5). The terms are interchangeable. To be united with Christ is to be united with other members of his body, other Christians.

We are confident we are hearing the same message as first-century listeners. Nevertheless, Scripture is always our only and final authority.
